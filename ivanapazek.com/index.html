This led her on a journey of spiritual depths, inner discovery and principles about how to live the life of her dreams, as well as teaching this knowledge to others.

					Ivana’s programs are dedicated to help people find their life purpose and live their ideal lives. These are people who have a whole list of accomplishments, but nothing that speaks to their soul, and says: <span class="italic">You have done something amazing with your life! You are magnificent!</span> They know that they want more, but feel trapped in their everyday realities and don’t know how to make their inner dreams a reality. What’s more, they are in the environment that doesn’t support a new vision for their life.<br/><br/>
					<span class="italic bold">Find your Joy-factor</span> is a step-by-step program to finding your life’s purpose, the very thing that brings the greatest joy in our lives. Finding our life purpose is the key component in living our ideal lives, and without it we will not feel fulfilled.<br/><br/>
					<span class="italic bold">Manifest your Ideal Life</span> is a program made to follow through with the book 
					<span class="italic">Lessons from Snow White</span>. We use hidden spiritual messages from the tale 
					<span class="italic">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</span> to learn how to manifest our ideal lives. <br/><br/>
					Once we realize, both the process of how to find our joy-factor and how to live our ideal lives, we can use it many times throughout our life. Our life purpose is not just one, and our vision of ideal life changes once we manifest what we want.

				<div class="col-md-8 work__text">It's so easy to trust Ivana. She gave me this amazing feeling of "being home with a friend". I felt that the minute I heard her voice a year ago. And my comfort and amazement are just growing with every session. Getting better and better-it is really possible with her. I’ve completely changed my relationships in my relatives, friends and my clients, with my idea of having my own family, the money can come and STAY with me, with my Man. Permanently, it is not possible to go back. And I do not want to,for it unfolds Great now (-: The best moments in my life in every area, especially with my boyfriend I have, thinking about and praising Ivana. Her ability to guide me through my own thoughts will always amaze me! Your calm and light nature, combined with these constant flashes of Insights were shocking (in The Best meaning of the word), is something I wish everyone who wants coaching to experience. Ivana is a treasure for everyone who knows her. I am proud of my ability to attract person like Ivana as my coach. It's obvious that I am really great in manifesting The Best!(-: So very happy for all her clients and for those who are now seeking her! They will be constantly surprised and delighted. I also admire everything she has accomplished in her own life! Her amazing connection with her husband, great job with great salary, beautiful body, her expansion as a coach for such a short time, her happy and grateful clients, That's what gives me even more credibility for her talent to assist people and transform their lives in gentle and such a pleasant way. I know it's not enough, I have so much more to say. Can not wait to have my next opportunity to praise! Love you Ivana so much and thank you for being in my Life! Yours, Svetlana</div>

					<br/> I would DEFENITELY recommend Ivana as a coach. She is very sensitive and perceptive. She knows immediately what is the essence of a problem, even when it’s difficult to see. Her comments are always deep, and coherent - each session is a gold nugget. She is always extremely positive, encouraging, supportive, and she never judges you. And the most important is that she never gives you any advice, but she gives the tools to transform on your own. What is different now, than before? Today I am very happy and positive. A lot of fears have disappeared. I take actions easily, I am not afraid any more of obstacles. I have a huge confidence in my potential. Last month i have get 5 auditions, it didn’t happened once in my whole life. I wanted to travel a lot, and this last 3 months I have been in 5 differents countries. I have been able to pay my rent every months without any retards. Something which is really huge for me is that I am not worried anymore. I was so so worried about everything … I feel free. and I know that step by step, I am building the life of my dreams. I have overcome a death grief. It was probably the most powerful session we had. My life is totally different since this day. I have also heal my back which was really painful for few months, and i am healing my ankle, injured for already 5 years. I have stopped smoking. And i am on the process to create very healthy habits. I am today totally conscious of my power to make my dream a reality. So now, nothing can stop me. This is my biggest victory.</div>

					<br/><br/> I would definitely recommend Ivana as a coach because she is a great empathetic and she has a beautiful and kind spirit which she brings to her coaching. The improvements I gained during and after working with Ivana are multi-layered, her patient and sensitive coaching gave me the needed support and clarity on my issues.She guided me with practical life tools to help me navigate and solve my issues both in the physical and from my heart and mind. She re-inforced my believe and faith in the future, I could look at the future with faith and trust. In working with Ivana, I gained clarity on the nature of life, setting boundaries and knowing that as long as you belief, you will receive. If I want to work on anything, it is to always remember this great lessons.
