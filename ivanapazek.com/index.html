                <p class="bio__content"> Things started to change when she began to explore not only the aspects of her mind, but also the infinite aspects of her higher being. This led her on a journey of spiritual depths, inner discovery and principles about how to live the life of her dreams, as well as teaching this knowledge to others. She became a Law of Attraction life coach and with her profound yet simple teachings, has helped people from Japan to Nigeria, and Germany to the US, to make their dream lives a reality. </p>
                <p class="bio__content">She currently lives with her husband in a peaceful part of Zagreb, Croatia, joyfully anticipating life's next adventure.

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text">It's so easy to trust Ivana. She gave me this amazing feeling of "being home with a friend" .I felt that the minute I heard her voice a year ago. And my comfort and amazement are just growing with every session. Getting better and better-it is really possible with her. I’ve completely changed my relationships in my relatives, friends and my clients, with my idea of having my own family, the money can come and STAY with me, with my Man. Permanently, it is not possible to go back. And I do not want to,for it unfolds Great now (-: The best moments in my life in every area, especially with my boyfriend I have, thinking about and praising Ivana. Her ability to guide me through my own thoughts will always amaze me! Your calm and light nature, combined with these constant flashes of Insights were shocking (in The Best meaning of the word), is something I wish everyone who wants coaching to experience. Ivana is a treasure for everyone who knows her. I am proud of my ability to attract person like Ivana as my coach. It's obvious that I am really great in manifesting The Best!(-: So very happy for all her clients and for those who are now seeking her! They will be constantly surprised and delighted. I also admire everything she has accomplished in her own life! Her amazing connection with her husband, great job with great salary, beautiful body, her expansion as a coach for such a short time, her happy and grateful clients, That's what gives me even more credibility for her talent to assist people and transform their lives in gentle and such a pleasant way. I know it's not enough, I have so much more to say. Can not wait to have my next opportunity to praise! Love you Ivana so much and thank you for being in my Life! Yours, Svetlana</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text">
                    <br/> I would DEFENITELY recommend Ivana as a coach. She is very sensitive and perceptive. She knows immediately what is the essence of a problem, even when it’s difficult to see. Her comments are always deep, and coherent - each session is a gold nugget. She is always extremely positive, encouraging, supportive, and she never judges you. And the most important is that she never gives you any advice, but she gives the tools to transform on your own. What is different now, than before? Today I am very happy and positive. A lot of fears have disappeared. I take actions easily, I am not afraid any more of obstacles. I have a huge confidence in my potential. Last month i have get 5 auditions, it didn’t happened once in my whole life. I wanted to travel a lot, and this last 3 months I have been in 5 differents countries. I have been able to pay my rent every months without any retards. Something which is really huge for me is that I am not worried anymore. I was so so worried about everything … I feel free. and I know that step by step, I am building the life of my dreams. I have overcome a death grief. It was probably the most powerful session we had. My life is totally different since this day. I have also heal my back which was really painful for few months, and i am healing my ankle, injured for already 5 years. I have stopped smoking. And i am on the process to create very healthy habits. I am today totally conscious of my power to make my dream a reality. So now, nothing can stop me. This is my biggest victory.</div>
