                        <p class="service__content">Here I mean: happy, that comes from knowing you are living the life of your dreams.</p>
                        <p class="service__content">And not: plastic happy, meant just for others to see.</p>
                        <p class="service__content"> Really, are you living in a <span class="bold">quiet despair</span>? Did all of your days start looking similar, stretching into a one long gray day? Is there something else you should be doing with your life, but don’t know what?</p>
                        <p class="service__content bold"> If that is you, I have some good news and some bad news.</p>
                        <p class="service__content"> Good news is that I can help you. I've been trained to know how and have discovered principles that work. It’s not more complicated than that.</p>
                        <p class="service__content"> The bad news is that most people find it difficult to ask for help and just go on their own. For most of them, this means losing faith in themselves, without experiencing a permanent change. They may feel happy for a while, but it doesn’t take long until they crash back. This makes them stop believing it’s possible for them and they continue doing things they don’t want to do, like a job they hate or meeting people they don't really like.</p>
                        <p class="service__content"> It goes on and on until one day they wake up and realize that they wasted so much time. And even when they start living the life of their dreams, they feel regret for not living it sooner.</p>
                        <p class="service__content bold"> Wouldn’t you like to start creating the life of your dreams right now?

                    <br> <span class="italic">Find Your Joy Factor</span> is a step-by-step program to find your life’s purpose, the very thing that makes our life worth living and brings us the greatest of joys.

                        <span class="italic">Manifest Your Ideal Life</span> is a program which teaches you to make the vision for your life a reality. It follows through with the book <span class="italic">Lessons from Snow White: Hidden Spiritual Messages to Manifest Your Ideal Life</span>. With the help of the tale <span class="italic">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</span> we learn the manifestation process in order to create our ideal life.
                        <br>
                        <br> These two programs <span class="italic">Find Your Joy Factor</span> and <span class="italic">Manifest Your Ideal Life</span> work together. Finding the purpose for your life is the key component in living your ideal life, and without it we will not feel fulfilled. Also, if we know what we want and not how to get it, we will not be able to have it as part of our reality.
                        <br> Once we realize, both the process of how to find our joy factor and how to live our ideal lives, we can use it many times throughout our life. Our life purpose is not just one, and our vision of ideal life changes once we manifest what we want.

                <div class="col-md-8 work__text">Ivana gave me this amazing feeling of "being home with a friend". I felt that the minute I heard her voice a year ago. Getting better and better-it is really possible with her. I’ve completely changed my relationships with my relatives, friends and clients. The money can come and STAY with me, with my Man. Permanently, it is not possible to go back. And I do not want to, for it unfolds Great now (-:
                    <br> Her calm and light nature, combined with these constant flashes of Insights were shocking (in The Best meaning of the word). Ivana is a treasure for everyone who knows her. I am proud of my ability to attract person like Ivana as my coach. It's obvious that I am really great in manifesting The Best! (-:
                    <br> I also admire everything she has accomplished in her own life! Her amazing connection with her husband, great job with great salary, beautiful body, her expansion as a coach for such a short time, her happy and grateful clients... That's what gives me even more credibility for her talent to assist people and transform their lives in gentle and such a pleasant way!</div>

                    <br/> I would DEFENITELY recommend Ivana as a coach.
                    <br> She is very sensitive and knows immediately what is the essence of a problem. She is always extremely positive, encouraging, supportive, and she never judges you. And the most important is that she never gives you any advice, but she gives the tools to transform on your own. Today I have a huge confidence in my potential as an actress. Last month I got 5 auditions, it didn’t happened once in my whole life. I wanted to travel a lot, and this last 3 months I have been in 5 differents countries. I know that step by step, I am building the life of my dreams. I have overcome a death grief. It was probably the most powerful session we had. My life is totally different since this day. I have stopped smoking.
                    <br> I am today totally conscious of my power to make my dream a reality. So now, nothing can stop me. This is my biggest victory.</div>

                    <br/>Ivana has this warm and gentle persona that creates the perfect atmosphere for learning and changing. She asks great questions and really listens, which is probably why she comes up with just the right words.
                    <br> She is wonderful! </div>

                    <br/> The improvements I gained during and after working with Ivana are multi-layered.
                    <br> She guided me with practical life tools to help me navigate and solve my issues both in the physical and from my heart and mind. She re-inforced my believe so that I could look at the future with faith and trust.
                    <br> In working with Ivana, I gained clarity on the nature of life, setting boundaries and knowing that as long as you belief, you will receive.

                            Ever since I can remember, I was interested in spending time with just a small number of people. Over the years, this was my sister, one friend in high school, one on the University, my husband,. . . (<span class="italic">In case you are wondering:</span> the friend from University and my husband are not the same person, so we can say 2 from the University. :))

                            For all others, I felt like I could read them, and didn’t want to spend time with them. It wasn’t like they were bad people, but I could immediately say that they were not a company for me.
                        </p>
                        <p class="journal_post">
                            Now, when I believe to be more spiritually conscious, my ability to read other people seems to got enhanced even more. It is like I know their thoughts, and thus their intention <span class="italic">immediately</span> – when they speak, or look at me, or just send me a message.

                            For example, when someone doesn’t have good intentions, I feel their negativity. If I pay attention to it, I feel it <span class="italic">very</span> strongly. This is why I needed to learn a way to quickly release it and come back to my inner state of <span class="bold">alignment</span>.

                            There are some people who believe I’m simply ignorant to their negativity, since I don’t return it. The truth is, I’m conscious of it, but choose not to <span class="bold">focus</span> on it. It is my decision to not be in that energy for long.

                            Lately, I come to the point when I cannot speak badly about someone without feeling real pain. It is true that I also talked badly about others before (who didn’t:)) but now it amazes me to see other people still doing it. It’s because I now know how much we hurt ourselves by belittling, or wanting to hurt others.

                            Our <span class="bold">words</span> are indeed <span class="bold">powerful</span>. If you heard it from me, or someone else, it is completely true. By comparing with others and playing the <span class="bold">comparison game</span>, we hurt ourselves badly.

                    <p> After graduating from a challenging program at the University of Mathematics and beginning a career in software development in Croatia, Ivana found herself having what many wanted, but not feeling fulfilled.</p>
                    <p> Things started to change when she began to explore not only the aspects of her mind, but also the infinite aspects of her higher being. This led her on a journey of spiritual depths, inner discovery and principles about how to live the life of her dreams, as well as teaching this knowledge to others. She became a Law of Attraction life coach and with her profound yet simple teachings, has helped people from Japan to Nigeria, and Germany to the US, to make their dream lives a reality. </p>
                    <p>She currently lives with her husband in a peaceful part of Zagreb, Croatia, joyfully anticipating life's next adventure.
